This is a broken Google App Engine application.
It may contains numerous bugs and unsecure code.

Here are some tip for fixing it:
* This app is a website of a summer camp. [Here](http://summer2015.infor.org/) is an example.
* It uses `webapp2` for core framework and `jinja2` for template engine.
* The Facebook App will only let you run the application at <http://localhost:8080>.
